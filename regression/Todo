JSON Reader:
Assigned to: Amber and Sam
Description:
	1. Retrieve matches1.json from the Riot API's getting started page.
	2. Parse the json file to see what fields are avialable
	3. Write a java program that takes in the json, and converts it into a json object. There may be existing libraries that do this, so do some digging around.
	4. Output the json into a .csv file for easier viewing. I'll leave it up to you guys to discuss formatting for the file. Remember that each matches*.json file contains 100 games.

Basic Regression Model:
Assigned to: Wilson and Nicholas
Description:
	1. Create the barebones java program that will perform our linear regression. There may be code online that may help us with this.
	2. There should be at least three methods: one for reading/constructing the data values; one for performing the actual regression; and one method to coordinate everything.
		a. The main task is to flesh out the regression method, but you guys should also prepare some tests to make sure the code is working.
		b. It's inputs should be the set of data points, and it should print out (to console or file) the coefficients for each variable.

Correlation Plot:
Assigned to: Justin
Description:
	1. Write a java program that will take in two sets of data and
		a. Make a figure to plot them
		b. Calculate and output the coefficient of correlation between the two variables.
